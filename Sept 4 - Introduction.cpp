/*
	Course Introduction

	-Course is very similar to C, but more focused on OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

	OOP is important because even small software can be 1000's of lines and 100's of functions. Large programs can be millions of lines of code 
	and thousands of functions.

	OOP: Designing code to know that based on a certain input, you will be given a specified and repeatable output. 
	Usually done with reusable functions. So long as the function gives you what you want, the method in which it gets there is irrelevant to
	the programmer. Very easy to maintain, as you can edit one function without the rest of the piece of software needing to be updated so long as it still meets the existing specification.
